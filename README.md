# Image-To-Hex
Converts an image into hexagons.

1. Put selected image into the same directory as the jar.
2. Run the program.
3. The output will be output.png, unless there is already an output.png, then it will go to the next number available. Output files will 
   never be overwritten.

Hexagon class made b/c Java doesn't have a Polygon.Double and it was simple enough to make for what I needed.
